You tell us your prediction by adding it to the Match/Game ID. A Home Win is 1, an Away Win is 2 and a Draw is X. You tell us how much you want to stake by adding your stake at the end of the bet. 100 KShs is 100. So, to bet 100 Kshs on a match with ID 6981, predicting a Home Win, you text the message 6981 #1#100 to our short code number.\nNext, a confirmation SMS will sent by the Company to your registered mobile line confirming your bet with its possible win (The winnings are calculated by multiplying the odds by the stake.

With a multi bet, you can combine up to twenty picks.\n\nAn example of this would be: Man Utd win (1.35), Arsenal win (1.75), Real Madrid win (2.00). To calculate your potential winnings you simply multiply the prices quoted for each selection, 1.35 x 1.75 x 2.00= 4.72. This means that, if your three selections win, you will win 4.72 times your bet.\n\n(a) Multi Bet via SMS\n\nSend an SMS to our short code number the sequence of each game ID and respective prediction followed by the bet amount as illustrated '1234#2#4534#1#7180#1#135', where 1234 is the Game ID,2 is the prediction, 4534 is the Game ID, 1 is the prediction, 7180 is the Game ID, 1 is the prediction and 135 is the bet amount.\n\nYou will receive a confirmation SMS from the Company containing all the details of the bet you have just placed.\n\nYou may cancel a Single Bet placed via SMS within ten minutes from placing the bet, however not after the kick-off of the game.\n\nTo Cancel a Multi Bet, placed via SMS you need to send the word 'cancel' followed by # sign and the Bet ID to the Company short code number 79079.\n\ne.g. Cancel#7687\n\nA cancelation confirmation message will be returned to you.\n\ne.g. The BET ID 7687 was cancelled.
